We will broadly see three types of problems.

1. Decision Problem: Is the input a YES or NO input?
> Example: Given graph G, nodes s, t, is there a path from s to t in G?
> Example: Given a CFG grammar G and string w, is w âˆˆ L(G)?

2. Search Problem: Find a solution if input is a YES input.
> Example: Given graph G, nodes s, t, find an s-t path.

3.  Optimization Problem: Find a best solution among all solutions for the input.
> Example: Given graph G, nodes s, t, find a shortest s-t path.
