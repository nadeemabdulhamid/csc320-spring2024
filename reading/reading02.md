(including introduction to the chapter)

1. When analyzing an algorithm, what two resources do we typically focus on? Of these two, which one is more important? Why is it more important?
> 

2. What is meant by size of input?
> 

3. Explain what is meant by basic operation and what it has to do with analyzing an algorithm.
> 

4. Of worst-case, average-case, and best-case efficiencies, which is least important and why?
> 

5. What is the difference between the worst-case and average-case efficiencies?
>
 
6. Why is it typically more difficult to determine the average-case complexity of an algorithm than the other two?
> 

7. Write down the definition of *$\mathcal{O}$-notation*.
> 

8. Write down the definition of *$\Theta$-notation*.
>

9. In English, what does it mean that $f(n)=\Theta(g(n))$?
>

10. Give a simple *Big-$\Theta$* bound on $13n^3 + 8n^2 - 5n + 35$.
>

11. Justify the claim that  $n^2 \in \mathcal{O}(n^3)$ using limits. (page 57)
>

12. Analyze the following algorithm. Give both the best-case and worst-case efficiencies. (Hint: It involves a double sum. Also, if you have $i$ or $j$ in your answer then you are doing it wrong.): [Comparison Counting Sort algorithm](./reading02-alg.pdf)
