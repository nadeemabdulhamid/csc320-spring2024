\subsection{Recursive algorithm}

Consider the following recursive algorithm for computing the sum of the first $n$ cubes:\\ $S(n) = 1^3 + 2^3 + \dots + n^3$.\\ ~

\begin{enumerate}[a.]
    \item Set up and solve a recurrence relation for the number of times the algorithm's basic operation is executed.
    \item How does this algorithm compare with the straightforward nonrecursive algorithm for computing this sum?
\end{enumerate}



\clearpage
\subsection{Another recursive algorithm}

Consider the following recursive algorithm.\\~

    \item Set up a recurrence relation for the algorithm's basic operation count and
    solve it.
\end{enumerate}
